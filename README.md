Hi there! I'm Dustin and I'm 23 years old, currently residing in New Mexico, USA, wanna to move more eastern though, to be closer to critical internet infrastructure.

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer but I strive to be as knowledgeable as possible in a wide variety of fields, a guy with many skills, but a master a none, which is exactly where I wanna be, I'm happy here. I like to make stuff that people might find useful, but currently my focus has been more on scaling enterprise grade networks, and maintaining highly available infrastructure. \
*(Need a bare metal kubernetes cluster with HA, or some systems administration? Let's chat)*
